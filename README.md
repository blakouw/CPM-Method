# CPM-Method Student Project

This project is a student endeavor focused on implementing the Critical Path Method (CPM) in project management. 
The CPM is a widely used technique for planning and managing complex projects. By analyzing the dependencies and durations of project activities, 
the CPM helps determine the critical path, which is the sequence of activities that must be completed on time for the project to meet its deadline.
